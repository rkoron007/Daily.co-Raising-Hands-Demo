# How to Implement the Raise Your Hand Feature

Thank about the phrase "raise your hand" and ask yourself what it means? It
brings to mind classrooms and enthused students raising their arms straight up
to the sky and straining to keep them there. In social situations raising your
hand in a group gives the visual cue that a person would like to ask a question
or give an answer. The world we live in is becoming a progressively more
remote-friendly and video calls are more commonplace than ever. Having the
ability to virtually "raise your hand" allows a call host to host large meetings
while still ensuring each individual can ask questions and get answers when
needed.

In this post we'll be covered how to implement the "raise your hand"
functionality with our simple video chat API.
